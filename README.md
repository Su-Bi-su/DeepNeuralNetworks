# DeepNeuralNetworks

## Simple_FullyConnectedNN.py
-> Implement fullyconnected neural network on MNIST dataset. 

-> MNIST dataset has 10 classes

-> Matplotlib is used to plot the loss curve.

## Simple_CNN_MNIST
-> Implemented CNN on MNIST dataset.

-> 10 class problem.

-> Tensorboard is used to plot the loss curve. 


## Simple_CNN_MNIST
-> Implemented CNN on CIFAR10 dataset.

-> 10 class problem with color images.

-> Tensorboard is used to plot the loss curve. 

-> for testing purpose.
